# Contributions

If you want to contribute to this project you can do so in 3 ways:
- Help with the Launcher written in python and using pygame
- Help with the VScript (add support to workshop maps or optimize/clean current code)
- Localize the launcher with different languages. You can do this by creating a folder called `languages` in your p2mm folder and start creating JSON files in it for each different language. Here is the base English.json to work off of: [Base English.json Translation File](https://github.com/kyleraykbs/Portal2-32PlayerMod/blob/main/src/languages/English.json)

# How to build the executable
This is optional if you prefer not to use official release compilations.

### Dependencies
all the dependencies are in the `requirements.txt` file  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Compilation
You will need `pyinstaller` in order to proceed.

- Windows: `pyinstaller src/MainWindow.py -F -i src/GUI/assets/images/p2mm64.ico --noconsole --add-data "src/GUI;GUI" --add-data "src/FALLBACK;FALLBACK" --add-data "src/languages;languages"`

- Linux: `pyinstaller "src/MainWindow.py" -F --add-data "src/GUI:GUI" --add-data "src/FALLBACK:FALLBACK" --add-data "src/languages:languages"`

**Note: If you would like to fork the project and make your own releases, you will need to change the variables at the top of `Updater.py`**
