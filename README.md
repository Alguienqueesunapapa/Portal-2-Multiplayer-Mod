# Contributions

If you want to contribute to this project you can do so in 3 ways:
1- Help with the Launcher written in python and using pygame
2- Help with the vscript (add support to workshop maps or optimize/clean current code)
3- localize the launcher (you can do this by creating a folder `languages` in your p2mm folder and create json files in it, [base translation file](https://github.com/kyleraykbs/Portal2-32PlayerMod/blob/main/src/languages/English.json))
